ERIC'S SUPER COOL SHELL CHEAT SHEET

COMMANDS LIST:

Note to self:  don't actually use quotation marks.
Note to self:  directory means folder, I think.

pwd               Prints the path of the current directory 
cat "filename"    A furry mammal.  Also opens a specific file.  
catf "filename"   Opens the file quickly (without the slow-type effect...
                  it's pretty, but gets annoying when I'm working fast)
cd "folder name"  Opens the folder named "folder name", unless that folder doesn't exist
ls                Prints out a huge list of all folders and files in the current directory
help              I MADE THIS!!  Prints this file!!
