Hi sweetie, I've been learning how to use this interwebz thingy 
so I can keep in contact with you now that
your are finally making your way in society. 
First, I just wanted to let you know how PROUD I am of you.

Do you remember why you first decided to go into this field of study, because I do. 
There was a cat passing by our house one day 
and some reckless idiot came careening out of nowhere in 
one of their large automobiles,
nearly running the poor thing over and scaring it have to death. 

It probably would have been too freaked out to look after itself. 
But you, sweet little boy that you were, 
took it and nursed it back to health. 
Of course, as I'm sure you remember, 
the kitten took a turn for the worse later and it turned out it had a TERMINAL DISEASE,
but you continued to look after and care for it until it finally passed away.

You also named the cat...what was it again...
