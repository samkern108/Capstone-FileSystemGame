Becky (8:45 AM):  Good morning.

Jake (8:46 PM):   Are you going crazy?

Becky (8:46 PM):  People can quit their jobs without having gone crazy.
                  Can you do me a favor?
                  I'm uninstalling the chat service, but I sent you an email.

Jake (8:46 PM):   Favor?

Becky (8:47 PM):  Read up.
                  But please try not to contact me.
                  Stay here.  Keep looking.
                  I made a mistake.  I had to leave before I could finish my work.

Jake (8:47 PM):   I don't understand.
                  You're scaring me.

Becky (8:47 PM):  But maybe you can find just how deep the rabbit hole goes,
                  as they say.
