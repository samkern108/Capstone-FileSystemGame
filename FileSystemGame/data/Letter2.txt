Hi sweetie, I'm sorry if my last letter bothered you. 
I'm getting old and emotional and sometimes it's hard for me
to concentrate. 
But you don't need to worry about me, 
I've still got plenty of life left in these old bones!

Hmm, that wasn't why I was writing this...what was it... Oh that's right. 
I remembered the name of the cat, it was WHISKERS.
I miss you sweetie, could you come visit sometime?
