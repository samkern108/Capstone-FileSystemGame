Hey, thanks for taking this over for me.  
I've just been so swamped at work with this Jake catastrophe.  
Things are really starting to simmer down, but being a project manager, 
we're having to reallocate a lot of resources.  

It's weird; someone dies and everything goes insane, but we reshuffle a little 
and within a week we're back to the same desks, the same schedules, the same company.  
Pharmatin hasn't changed.  I suppose it takes a lot of force to move such a giant.

Well, anyway, thanks again for doing this.  
I was supposed to recover all Pharmatin IP from Jake's computer after he died, 
but everyone's acting... odd about it.  
I think there's something worth finding on this computer.  

I'm pretending to hold the computer while I search it.  
You're not technically supposed to have this, and the company doesn't know.  
But you just know so much more about computers than I do, 
and I'm confident that if there's anything to be found, you'll find it.  

All of the interesting files are password protected, but I know Jake.  
He was a practical guy.  
If you do some digging, I bet you can crack his passwords.  

I mean, he's the kind of guy who codenamed his thesis project "Leanne."  
Know who that was?  His ex.  
Know what the project covered?  Malignant tumors.  
Super subtle, right?

Let me know what you end up finding.  I'm relying on you!

P.S.:  I just need to brag:  
I learned how to make a shell alias.  
It's nothing too fancy, just redirects to a file of shell commands 
that helped me navigate around the hard drive.  
Seriously, just type in "help"; it totally works this time.

Try it right now.  Type in "help".  Are you proud of me?  ;)
