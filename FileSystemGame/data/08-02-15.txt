Jake (2:12 PM):   Hey, what's the code for the lab?
                  I'm locked out.
                  I'm just pretending to be on the phone.  It's really awkward.

Jake (2:18 PM):   Save me, Becky!

Becky (2:31 PM):  Oh, no!!!
                  I was in a meeting!  Did you get in?

Jake (2:32 PM):   Nope.
                  I'm dead.
                  You killed me.

Becky (2:32 PM):  The code is 88293...

Jake (2:33 PM):   No, it's too late. I'm dead.
                  X__x

Becky (2:35 PM):  Cool, well as long as you got that spreadsheet written up.
                  R.I.P.

Jake (2:35 PM):   It's cool, Eric let me in.
                  He saw through my clever 20-minute phone call disguise.
                  And I forwarded you the budget thing like 15 minutes ago.

Becky (2:38 PM):  Oh, thanks.

Jake (2:38 PM):   Wow, you don't even feel guilty that I almost died.

Becky (2:40 PM):  I would've gone to the funeral.
                  Go do work or something!  You'll give me a bad rep.

Becky (3:17 PM):  Jake
                  Are you sure these numbers are right?

Jake (3:20 PM):   Lol, no.
                  I didn't write the spreadsheet.  I just bounced it from
                  accounting to Cameron and back.
                  Intern work is super fun.

Jake (3:27 PM):   Is everything okay?

Becky (3:30 PM):  Probably a mistake.  I'll go chat with Cameron.

Jake (3:30 PM):   Huh.  Okay.
