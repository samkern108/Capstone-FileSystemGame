Becky (8:23 AM):  Are you nervous?

Jake (8:27 AM):   Ha ha, sorry, I couldn't figure out how to open the chat.

Becky (8:27 AM):  A lot of new tech to get used to.  
                  Or, I suppose, a lot of new tech to get un-used to.
                  I think my monitor was built in 1985.

Jake (8:45 AM):   Likely.
                  Yeah, I think I am nervous.
                  I'm meeting with Cameron soon.

Becky (8:49 AM):  Is he your PM?

Jake (8:50 AM):   PM?

Becky (8:50 AM):  Project Manager.

Jake (8:52 AM):   Oh, yeah.

Becky (8:52 AM):  Cameron is great with new hires!  He'll take good care of you.

Jake (8:53 AM):   I hope so, ha ha.
                  I'm going to head out.  Lunch today, maybe?  I want to catch up!

Becky (8:54 AM):  Definitely don't be late!
                  Sure, sandwiches at 12?
                  It's going to be weird, being coworkers with a former student of mine.
                  Glad you got the job, though!
                  You'll do well here!

Jake (8:55 AM):   I hope I don't get lost!
                  Every hallway looks the same.
                  Okay, 12 it is.
                  Thanks, Becky!  :)
