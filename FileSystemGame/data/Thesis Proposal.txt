Few things have plagued our country (almost literally) as much as the various types of canver. They have been a prevalent threat
and yet we have yet to actually create an effective cure. But I believe it is time this problem recieved more concentrated attention.
Millions have had to suffer as we've focused our efforts in other areas, that time to address this epidemic is now!


Current chemotherapy drugs target all rapidly dividing cells - indiscriminately killing both cancerous and healthy cells.
 Delivering the drugs selectively to where they are needed could allow much smaller amounts to be administered to patients
 - perhaps cutting the dose hundreds or even thousands of times. The group plans to achieve this by packaging drugs inside honeycomb-like
 nanostructures. The structures include tiny 'nanovalves' that can be opened and closed, releasing the drug molecules precisely where
 they are needed. Depending on the type of cancer being treated, different methods can be used to trigger the release


There are a variety of ways we can power these nanomachines. Light can be used to generate an electron which drives
 the moving part, but we can also use a chemical trigger to do this, for example using a reducing agent to produce an electron.


But the technology could also provide access to new and powerful cancer therapies. For example - researchers have already shown 
that mechanised nanoparticles can be used to deliver previously unusable treatments such as camptothecin - a hydrophobic cancer drug
 that is difficult to administer due to its poor solubility in blood

So please support me in the development of this technology to save millions of lives worldwide!
